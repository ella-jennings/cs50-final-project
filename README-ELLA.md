# Final Project

## Rationale
I spend a lot of time playing the game Lost Cities, but it can be annoying to add up all the scores. What better way to keep track of what I'm doing than by making this my final project

## Goals

### Within scope of CS50 assignment
* Create simple application with homepage ✅
* Create score for 1 round, with 6 colours (no bonuses) ✅
* Add deal card bonus functionality ✅
* Add 8 card bonus
* Add ability to reset row
* Add ability to reset player 
* Optimise for mobile view
* Add option for 5 or 6 colours
* Add option for second player
* Declare winner
* Add option for 3-round games

### Possible Future Functionality
* Add login functionality
* Logged in user can save regular players
* Logged in user can select from players created when choosing game
* Saved players can have stats (games played, highest total)
* Game will display new stats at the end of each round/game (depending on stat)
