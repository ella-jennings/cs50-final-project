# Final Project

## Rationale
I spend a lot of time playing the game Lost Cities, but it can be annoying to add up all the scores. What better way to keep track of what I'm doing than by making this my final project

## Goals

* Create simple application with homepage
* Create score for 1 round, with 5 colours (no bonuses)
* Add deal card bonus functionality
* Add option for 6th colour
* Add option for second player, and declare winner
* Add option for 3-round games
* Add login functionality
* Logged in user can save regular players
* Logged in user can select from players created when choosing game
* Saved players can have stats (games played, highest total)
* Game will display new stats at the end of each round/game (depending on stat)

## How to run
1. From project home, in terminal enter `cd api`.
2. Set `export FLASK_URL=application.py`.
3. Run `flask run` from terminal in that location.
